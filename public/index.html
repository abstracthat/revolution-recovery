          At Revolution Recovery, we believe recovery is more than breaking free
          from addiction—it’s about
          <strong

            environment</strong
          >.

        <p>
          Each resident participates in creating a
          <strong>personalized recovery plan</strong> that acknowleges the
          importance of mental health throughout recovery. We facilitate
          connections with trusted community providers who offer

        <p>
          We encourage residents to take in the restorative beauty of
          nature—from nearby <strong>hiking trails</strong> to a
          <strong
            >quiet creek with a bench for peaceful prayer or meditation</strong
          >—while also engaging in wellness resources that support whole-person
          healing.
        </p>
        <p>
          All plans are <strong>person-centered</strong> and respect the
          uniqueness of every recovery path, including residents on
          <strong>MAT (Medication Assisted Treatment)</strong>.
